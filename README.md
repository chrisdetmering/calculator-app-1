## Summary

This app was written using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no libraries). The focus of this project was to provide a basic calculator that could perform essential operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additonally, the calculator can perform continuous operation.

In the future I'd like to:

- Simplify the logic/lines of code with a custom parser
- Add memory functionality
- Support advanced operation
